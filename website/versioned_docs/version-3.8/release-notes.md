## 3.8.0

We're happy to announce the next release of Lightweight Chartsâ„¢ library. This release includes many improvements and bug fixes (as usual), but we are thrilled to say that from this version the library has its own [documentation website](https://tradingview.github.io/lightweight-charts/) that replaces the documentation in the repository. Check it out and share your feedback in [this discussion thread](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/discussions/921).

## 3.6.1

**Fixed**

- In v3.6.0 there was a typo in `LasPriceAnimationMode` const enum (`Last` without `t`), which was fixed in this release. The incorrect name is still available to import and could be used in your code so no breaking change so far (see e5133cb0c50fc557182aba4011e170aaf30a5b1a)

See [changes since the last published version](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/compare/v3.6.0..v3.6.1).

## 3.6.0

## 3.5.0

**A note about rendering order of series, which might be interpret as a bug or breaking change since this release**

This is not really a breaking change, but might be interpret like that. In [#794](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/794) we've fixed the wrong order of series, thus now all series will be displayed in opposite order (they will be displayed in order of creating now; previously they were displayed in reversed order).

To fix that, just change the order of creating the series (thus instead of create series A, then series B create series B first and then series A) - see [#812](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/812).

**Fixed**

- Screenshot output missing piece on bottom right (see [#798](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/798))
- Overlapped line chart show wrong color order when hover (see [#794](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/794))
- Price line label show on both axis (see [#795](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/795))

## 3.1.5

It's a just re-published accidentally published 3.1.4 version, which didn't actually fix the issue [#536](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/536).

Version 3.1.4 has been deprecated.

**Fixed**

- TypeError `_internal_priceScale is not a function` while getting series price scale (see [#536](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/536))

See [issues assigned to this version's milestone](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/milestone/16?closed=1) or [changes since the last published version](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/compare/v3.1.3..v3.1.5).

See [issues assigned to this version's milestone](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/milestone/13?closed=1) or [changes since the last published version](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/compare/v3.1.1..v3.1.2).

## 3.1.1

**Fixed**

- Fixed production build of 3.1 version (see [#502](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/502) and [62aa93724e40fbb1b678d9b44655279a1df529c5](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/commit/62aa93724e40fbb1b678d9b44655279a1df529c5))

See [issues assigned to this version's milestone](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/milestone/12?closed=1) or [changes since the last published version](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/compare/v3.1.0..v3.1.1).

## 3.1.0

**Enhancement**

- Whitespaces support (see [#209](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/209))
- Custom font families for watermarks (see [#437](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/437))

**Fixed**

- Added support for 'transparent' color (see [#491](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/491))
- Refactor DataLayer/ChartApi (see [#270](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/270))
- Remove series then scroll to right after not working (see [#355](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/355))
- Scaling via mouse click and drag doesn't work if chart is inside shadow root (see [#427](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/427))
- Applying watermark in setTimeout doesn't make an effect (see [#485](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/485))
- Importing the library in server-side context caused `ReferenceError` (see [#446](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/446))

**Undocumented breaking changes**

We know that some of users probably used some hacky-workarounds calling internal methods to achieve multi-pane support. In this release, to reduce size of the bundle we [dropped out a code for pane's separator](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/pull/496) (which allows to resize panes).

As soon this workaround is undocumented and we don't support this feature yet - we don't bump a major version. But we think it's better to let you know that it has been changed.

**Development**

- Dropped support NodeJS < 12.18
- Migrated from TSLint to ESLint (see [#314](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/314))
- Migrated from clean-publish to in-house script to clear package.json (see [#474](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/474))

## 3.0.1

**Fixed**

- Correctly handle `overlay: true` in series options while create series to backward compat (see [#475](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/475))

See [issues assigned to this version's milestone](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/milestone/10?closed=1) or [changes since the last published version](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/compare/v3.0.0..v3.0.1).

## 3.0.0

**Breaking changes**

We have some breaking changes since the latest version due some features and API improvements:

- Methods `subscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange` and `unsubscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange` has been moved from ChartApi to TimeScaleApi
- Since 3.0 you can specify price axis you'd like to place the series on. The same for moving the series between price scales (see migration guide below)

See [breaking changes doc](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/blob/master/docs/3.0-breaking-changes.md) with migration guide to migrate smoothly.

**Added**

- Add ability to override series' autoscale range (see [#392](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/392))
